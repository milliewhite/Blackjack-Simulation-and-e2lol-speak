## English to LOL Speak
* An English-to-Lolcat translation engine.
* Reads in a plain-text file in English (.txt extension)
* Translates it and produces another text file in Lolcat, regardless of the length of the text. 
* The program takes the path of the file as its only argument
* Saves the resulting translated file in the same path with the same name, except with a _lolcat suffix.
